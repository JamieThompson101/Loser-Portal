# Loser-Portal
##Inspired by Space Jam Website

A picture of his avatar and a greeting
“Hello, Welcome to my website”
Background with pixelated stars
Ask for images/gifs to add to the directory of his website
Stupid, animated gifs most likely from old video games or pop culture references
One page dedicated to links
Interest page(s): music, art history, video games, etc.
Each of the interest page(s) would have his own text that I just need to copy and paste into the html file in vscode
