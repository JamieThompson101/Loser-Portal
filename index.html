 <h1>Sports page</h1>
 <p>One of my biggest hobbies is watching Sports! I wasn't really into it when I was younger but by my mid 20s I got hooked on baseball and then other sports followed. I watched some baseball as a young person but it was 2015 or so that I got really really into it. Baseball is my favorite sport and basketball probably my second favorite and between those two sports I'm busy for most all of the year. My favorite baseball teams are the Cubs, Cardinals, Diamondbacks, Braves, Royals, Rays, Nationals, more. For basketball I like the Bulls, Bucks, Suns, Cavaliers, Spurs, more. For football, I'm a Bears guy, so pray for me. I also like the Chiefs and I love laughing at the Commanders. For Hockey I can only get myself to really care about the Blackhawks. For soccer I chose "my team" as Crystal Palace but I don't have much knowledge of the team yet, something to work towards. I am very interested in Illinois sports, Wisconsin sports, midwest sports. My favorite athlete ever is Michael Jordan by far.
